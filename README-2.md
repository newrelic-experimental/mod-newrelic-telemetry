# Build
## Install Apache HTTPD as appropriate for your machine
## Install Boost C++ Library
- Download Boost
- Decompress it
- Set the commented variables in `CMakeLists.txt` to the root of the decompressed file
- NOTE: There is no need to build Boost as this code uses _header only_ Boost libraries
